The labyrinth game with an AI agent project aims to create an interactive and challenging gaming experience where players navigate through a maze, collect rewards, and reach the exit. 
The inclusion of an AI agent, powered by the A* algorithm, adds an additional layer of complexity and strategy to the game.

## Objectives 

Implementing an AI agent using the A* algorithm for optimal pathfinding. 
Allowing player interaction and control within the labyrinth. 
Incorporating rewards within the maze for both the player and the AI agent.

## Game Mechanics

## Labyrinth Design
The labyrinth is represented as a 2D array of cells, where each cell can be either open or blocked. 
The maze design is customizable, allowing for the creation of diverse and challenging levels.
## AI Agent
The AI agent employs the A* algorithm for pathfinding. It intelligently navigates the labyrinth, considering the shortest path to the exit while avoiding obstacles.
## Rewards
Rewards are strategically placed within the labyrinth. Both the player and the AI agent can collect rewards, contributing to their scores. 
Rewards act as incentives to explore different parts of the maze.
## AI Adaptation
The AI agent's adaptation is marked by intelligent decision-making grounded in the A* algorithm.
It dynamically recalculates optimal paths in real-time, balancing pursuit of rewards with the goal of efficiently reaching the maze exit. 
The AI's adaptability includes dynamic obstacle avoidance, steering clear of obstacles and maintaining unpredictability.
